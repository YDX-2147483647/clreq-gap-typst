/**
 * Patch htmldiff
 *
 * https://services.w3.org/htmldiff is running `htmldiff` (the python script),
 * and it will execute `htmldiff.pl` in CLI (rather than CGI) mode.
 *
 * The commit version might be the following:
 * https://github.com/w3c/htmldiff-ui/blob/5eac9b073c66b24422df613a537da2ec2f97f457/htmldiff.pl
 *
 * ## Improve readability for `<pre>`
 *
 * This is a bug of htmldiff.
 *
 * When `<pre>` and `</pre>` is on the same line, `splitit` should set `$preformatted` to true, but not.
 * https://github.com/w3c/htmldiff-ui/blob/main/htmldiff.pl#L406-L412
 *
 * Additionally, `markit` will drop all characters after `<` for deleted (or replaced) lines.
 * As a result, htmldiff does not work as expected even if `$preformatted` has been set to true`.
 * https://github.com/w3c/htmldiff-ui/blob/5eac9b073c66b24422df613a537da2ec2f97f457/htmldiff.pl#L167-L168
 *
 * Therefore, let us ignore itâ€¦
 *
 * ## Replace the keyboard navigation script
 *
 * Replace it with src/htmldiff-nav.ts
